# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 1: Introduction to Python and Variables

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository will contain all the code and projects I work on during Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
Today, I started my Python programming journey by getting familiar with the basics. I learned about variables, data types, and how to perform simple calculations in Python.

## What I've Learned
- Declaring and using variables in Python.
- Understanding different data types (integers, floats, strings).
- Performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Project(s)
- None for today. Tomorrow, I'll start working on my first project.

## Thoughts
I'm excited to embark on this 100-day journey of coding in Python. Today's session was a great introduction, and I'm looking forward to applying what I've learned in future projects.

See you tomorrow for Day 2!
