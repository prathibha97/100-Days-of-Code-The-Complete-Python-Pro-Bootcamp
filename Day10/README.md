# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 10: Functions with Outputs & Calculator App

Welcome back to my coding journey! Today marks the tenth day of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I delved into functions with outputs today. I learned how to return values from functions and applied this knowledge in building a simple calculator application.

## What I've Learned
- Understanding and working with functions that have outputs (return values).
- Developed a basic calculator application.

## Project(s)
- Completed a functional calculator application. It's great to have a tool that can perform various calculations!

## Thoughts
Functions with outputs open up new possibilities for creating versatile and reusable code.

See you tomorrow for Day 11!
