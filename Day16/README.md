# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Coffee Machine

Hello again! Today is the sixteenth day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I delved into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and applied them in creating a Coffee Machine program. OOP is a paradigm that allows for more organized and modular code.

## What I've Learned
- Understanding the principles of OOP.
- Implementing classes, objects, and methods in Python.

## Link to the Course

## Project(s)
- Completed the Coffee Machine program using OOP principles. It's a great example of how OOP can enhance code structure and organization.

## Thoughts
Object-Oriented Programming provides a powerful way to structure code. Excited to apply these principles in future projects!

See you tomorrow for Day 17!
