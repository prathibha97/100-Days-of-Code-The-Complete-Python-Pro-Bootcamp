# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 19: Instances, State, and Higher Order Functions

Welcome back to my coding journey! Today marks the nineteenth day of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I continued exploring the Turtle Graphics library in Python and applied it in creating a Turtle Racing Game. This project involved managing instances and state in the context of a graphical application.

## What I've Learned
- Further application of Turtle Graphics in Python.
- Managing instances and state to create an interactive Turtle Racing Game.
- Utilizing higher-order functions in the development process.

## Project(s)
- Completed the Turtle Racing Game using Turtle Graphics. It's a fun and engaging way to explore the principles of object-oriented programming in a visual context, along with incorporating higher-order functions for added functionality.

## Thoughts
Building a Turtle Racing Game provided hands-on experience in managing instances and state in a graphical environment. It's exciting to see the turtles race to the finish line, and using higher-order functions added an extra layer of functionality to the project!

See you tomorrow for Day 20!
