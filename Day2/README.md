# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 2: Understanding Data Types and Manipulating Strings

Welcome back to my 100 Days of Code journey! This repository will contain all the code and projects I work on during Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
Today, I delved deeper into Python's data types. I learned about strings and how to manipulate them. I also explored string concatenation and learned about different string methods.

## What I've Learned
- Manipulating strings using various built-in methods.
- Understanding the concept of string concatenation.
- Gained a better understanding of string indexing and slicing.

## Thoughts
The concepts of strings are becoming clearer, and I'm feeling more comfortable with Python. Excited to start working on projects!

See you tomorrow for Day 3!
