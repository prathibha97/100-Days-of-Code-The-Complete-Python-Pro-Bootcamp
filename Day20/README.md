# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 20: Snake Game Part 1 - Animation & Coordinates

Hello again! Today is the twentieth day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I started building the Snake Game, focusing on Part 1 - Animation & Coordinates. This initial phase involves setting up the game window, creating the snake, and implementing basic animation using coordinates.

## What I've Learned
- Setting up a game window in Python using the Turtle Graphics library.
- Handling coordinates and animation for basic game elements.
- Laying the foundation for building a Snake Game.
