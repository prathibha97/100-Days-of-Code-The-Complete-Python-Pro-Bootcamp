## Day 21: Snake Game Part 2 - Control, Direction, and Collision Detection

Hello again! Today is the twenty-first day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
Continuing the Snake Game project, I concluded Part 2. This phase focused on user control for the snake's direction and implementing collision detection between the snake and other game elements.

## What I've Learned
- Finalizing user control and direction for the snake.
- Implementing collision detection to enhance the Snake Game.
