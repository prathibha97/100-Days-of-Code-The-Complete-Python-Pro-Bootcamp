# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 27: Tkinter, args, kwargs, and Creating GUI Programs

Welcome back to my coding journey! Today is the twenty-seventh day of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I explored the Tkinter library, learned about `args` and `kwargs`, and applied these concepts in creating GUI programs. Tkinter is a powerful tool for building graphical user interfaces in Python.

## What I've Learned
- Basics of Tkinter for GUI development.
- Understanding `args` and `kwargs` for flexible function parameter handling.

## Project(s)
- Created GUI programs using Tkinter and implemented `args` and `kwargs` for flexible function parameters.

## Thoughts
Tkinter opens up a world of possibilities for creating interactive applications. Learning about `args` and `kwargs` adds flexibility to function design!

See you tomorrow for Day 28!
