# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 28: Tkinter, Dynamic Typing, and the Pomodoro GUI Application

Hello again! Today is the twenty-eighth day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I continued working with Tkinter, explored dynamic typing, and applied these concepts in creating the Pomodoro GUI Application. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals.

## What I've Learned
- Advanced usage of Tkinter for GUI application development.
- Understanding dynamic typing in Python.

## Project(s)
- Completed the Pomodoro GUI Application, integrating Tkinter and dynamic typing.

## Thoughts
Building a Pomodoro timer was a practical way to apply Tkinter concepts and understand dynamic typing. It's a useful tool for productivity!

See you tomorrow for Day 29!
