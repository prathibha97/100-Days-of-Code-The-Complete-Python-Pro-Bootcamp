# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 3: Control Flow and Conditional Statements

Hello again! Today marks the third day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I dove into the world of control flow in Python. I learned about if-else statements, elif statements, logical operators and how to use them to make decisions in my code.

## What I've Learned
- Conditional statements (if, else, elif) for controlling the flow of execution.
- Using comparison operators for decision-making.

## Project(s)
- Started working on a simple treasure island game that utilizes conditional statements and logical operators. It's exciting to see the code make decisions!

## Thoughts
Control flow is a crucial aspect of programming. I'm looking forward to applying these concepts to more complex projects in the coming days.

See you tomorrow for Day 4!
