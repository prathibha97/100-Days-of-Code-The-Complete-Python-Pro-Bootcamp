# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 33: API Endpoints, API Parameters - ISS Overhead Notifier

Hello again! Today is the thirty-third day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I delved into working with API endpoints and parameters. This knowledge was applied in creating the ISS Overhead Notifier, a program that notifies when the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead.

## What I've Learned
- Understanding API endpoints and parameters.
- Building an ISS Overhead Notifier using real-time data.

## Project(s)
- Created the ISS Overhead Notifier using API endpoints and parameters.

## Thoughts
Interacting with real-time data through APIs adds a dynamic dimension to programming. The ISS Overhead Notifier is a practical example of utilizing API information!

See you tomorrow for Day 34!
