# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 37: Habit Tracking Project - API Post Requests and Headers

Welcome back to my coding journey! Today is the thirty-seventh day of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I continued working on the Habit Tracking Project, focusing on API Post Requests and Headers. This phase involved interacting with an API to track and manage habits.

## What I've Learned
- Making POST, PUT and DELETE requests to APIs for data manipulation.
- Understanding and using headers in API requests.

## Thoughts
Interacting with APIs for data manipulation opens up new possibilities. The Habit Tracking Project is becoming more dynamic and functional!

See you tomorrow for Day 38!
