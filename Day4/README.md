# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 4: Randomisation and Python Lists

Welcome back to my coding journey! Today is the fourth day of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
Today, I explored how to generate random numbers and make use of the `random` module in Python. Additionally, I learned about lists - a fundamental data structure in Python.

## What I've Learned
- Using the `random` module to generate random numbers.
- Manipulating and working with Python lists.

## Project(s)
- Started building a simple Rock, Paper Scissor game using randomization and lists. It's starting to come together!

## Thoughts
Randomization adds an exciting element to programming. I'm excited to see what kind of projects I can create with this newfound knowledge.

See you tomorrow for Day 5!
