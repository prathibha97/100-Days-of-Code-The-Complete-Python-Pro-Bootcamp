# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 54: Introduction to Web Development with Flask

Hello again! Today is the fifty-fourth day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I worked on the Web Scraping Capstone - Data Entry Job Automation. This project involves automating the extraction and entry of job data from a website.

## What I've Learned
- Basics of Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.
- Setting up a simple Flask application and running it locally.
