# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 55: HTML, URL Parsing in Flask, and the Higher Lower Game

Hello again! Today is the fifty-fifth day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I explored HTML integration with Flask, learned about URL parsing, and built a fun project - the Higher Lower Game using Flask.

## What I've Learned
- Passing data through URL parameters in Flask.
- Integrating HTML with Flask routes to display content.
- How to handle user interactions and responses dynamically.
- Created a Higher Lower Game that provides feedback based on the user's guess.

## Project(s)
- Developed the Higher Lower Game using Flask and HTML.

## Thoughts
Todayâ€™s lesson combined Flask and dynamic content in an engaging way. The Higher Lower Game was a fun project that tested both my understanding of Flask routes and user input handling. Iâ€™m excited to see how much more I can build with Flask!

See you tomorrow for Day 56! ðŸš€
