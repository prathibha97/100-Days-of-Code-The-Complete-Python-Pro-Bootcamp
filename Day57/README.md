# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 57: Templating with Jinja in Flask Applications

Hello again! Today is the fifty-seventh day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I explored how to use Jinja, Flaskâ€™s templating engine, to create dynamic web pages by embedding Python logic directly into HTML templates.

## What I've Learned
- Embedding Python expressions and logic in HTML using Jinja syntax.
- Using Jinja's control structures like loops and conditionals for dynamic content.
- Passing Python data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) to templates and rendering them.
- Understanding and utilizing template inheritance to create reusable layouts.

## Project(s)
- Built a blog application with Flask demonstrating dynamic content rendering with Jinja.
- Created a reusable website layout using template inheritance.

## Thoughts
Learning to use Jinja in Flask has been eye-opening! Itâ€™s powerful how Python logic integrates directly into HTML to produce dynamic content. Template inheritance simplifies the process of managing layouts, making web development much more efficient.

See you tomorrow for Day 58! ðŸš€
