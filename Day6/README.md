# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 6: Python Functions & Karel

Welcome back to my coding journey! Today marks the sixth day of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
Today, I dived into the world of functions in Python. I learned how to define and call functions, and also started working with Karel, a fun little robot simulator.

## What I've Learned
- Defining and calling functions in Python.
- Understanding function parameters and return values.
- Started working with Karel to solve simple tasks.

## Project(s)
- Implemented a few simple programs using functions. They're a powerful way to organize code!

## Thoughts
Functions provide a structured way to break down code into reusable components. Looking forward to incorporating them into more complex projects.

See you tomorrow for Day 7!
