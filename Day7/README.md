# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 7: Python Hangman Game

Hello again! Today is the seventh day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
Today, I worked on creating a Hangman game in Python. It was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge of strings, loops, and conditional statements.

## What I've Learned
- Reinforced string manipulation skills.
- Implemented user input and validation.
- Gained experience in working with loops and conditional statements.
