# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 8: Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher

Welcome back to my coding journey! Today marks the eighth day of Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I delved deeper into functions, particularly function parameters. Additionally, I implemented a Caesar Cipher, which was a great exercise in combining functions and string manipulation.

## What I've Learned
- Understanding and working with function parameters.
- Implemented a simple encryption algorithm (Caesar Cipher).

## Project(s)
- Completed a functional Caesar Cipher program. It's exciting to see how simple encryption works!

## Thoughts
Functions are becoming more intuitive, and I'm starting to see their power in making code more modular and reusable.

See you tomorrow for Day 9!
