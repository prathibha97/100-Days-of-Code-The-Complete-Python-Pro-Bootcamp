# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 9: Dictionaries, Nesting, and the Secret Auction

Hello again! Today is the ninth day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I explored dictionaries in Python and learned about nesting data structures. I also applied these concepts in building a Secret Auction program.

## What I've Learned
- Understanding and working with dictionaries and nested data structures.
- Applied dictionary knowledge in a practical program (Secret Auction).

## Project(s)
- Completed a functional Secret Auction program. It's exciting to see how dictionaries can be used in real-world scenarios!

## Thoughts
Dictionaries add a powerful layer of organization to data. I'm looking forward to incorporating them in more complex projects.

See you tomorrow for Day 10!
