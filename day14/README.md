# 100 Days of Code - Python Pro Bootcamp
## Day 14: Higher Lower Game

Hello again! Today is the fourteenth day of my 100 Days of Code journey with Dr. Angela Yu's Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023.

## Today's Progress
I explored higher-order functions and applied them in the context of creating a Higher Lower Game. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

## What I've Learned
- Understanding and using higher-order functions.
- Applied higher-order functions in the context of the Higher Lower Game.

## Project(s)
- Created a fully functional Higher Lower Game using higher-order functions. It's an engaging game that tests the player's intuition!

## Thoughts
Higher-order functions provide a powerful toolset for creating dynamic and interactive programs. The Higher Lower Game was a fun project to implement.

See you tomorrow for Day 15!
